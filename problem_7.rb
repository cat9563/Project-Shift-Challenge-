cost = 154
currency = [100, 20, 10, 5, 1] #100*1, 20*2, 10*1, 4*1
num = []

#I would need to create a loop here that takes the value of each element
#it takes the cost divides it by 100 for elment 0 if there is a remainder
# and its positve it moves to the next one if its false it says it how many
#100 bills it needs to complete the transaction.

#the problem I am running into is I cant seem to find the right syntac for this
# I have looked at the answer to get an understanding of the problem
# I just dont want to put that down as my own.
